## Code book
 This repository includes a raw dataset, in directory "UCI HAR Dataset", and two cleaned datasets in directory "TidyData". This document describes the two cleaned datasets. The raw dataset is described by "UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt".  
 
 See README.md for general information about the transformation of the raw dataset to the cleaned datasets. The script run_analysis.R will reproduce the processing.  
 
### TidyDataMeasurentMeansAndStandardDeviations.tsv  
 This file contains 68 tab-separated columns and 10,299 rows.  
 The contents of this file were derived from "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt" and "UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt" by adding information about subject (from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt) and about activity (from y_train.txt and y_test.txt) and then merging the train and test datasets. A unique identifier for each row was added as a column named observation. Columns containing mean data were selected from the combined dataset and placed in a new table, along with the observation, subject, and activity columns. Numeric codes in the activity column were replaced by text descriptions taken from "UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", and abbreviations in the original column names were expanded.

### TidyData/AverageByActivityOrSubjectOfMeasurentMeansAndStandardDeviations.tsv
This file has 68 tab-separated columns and 36 rows. 
It was derived from TidyDataMeasurentMeansAndStandardDeviations.tsv by separately grouping the rows by activity and calculating the column means for each group of rows. The two sets of means were then concatenated to form a single data table.
